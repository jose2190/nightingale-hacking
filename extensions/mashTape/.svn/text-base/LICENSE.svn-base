The rest of the source for this (the mashTape add-on) is covered under
the below BSD license + Patent License

The POTI BSD + Patent License has been written to provide maximum flexibility
to the recipient, as it does not require the recipient to use a particular
license for the recipient's derivative software (unlike the GPL), nor does it
require the recipient to grant any patent licenses to the recipient's
derivative software (unlike the GPL). 

In addition, the POTI BSD + Patent License (unlike the BSD license) grants a
patent license from POTI not only to POTI's mashTape add-on (the "Software")
itself, but also to any POTI patent claims that might cover corrections made
by the recipient.

The text of the POTI BSD + Patent License follows:

Recipient has requested a license and Pioneers of the Inevitable, Incorporated
("POTI") is willing to grant a license for the software entitled Songbird
mashTape Add-On (the "Software") being provided by POTI.

  the software.

* "Licensee" means Recipient and those third parties that receive a license
  to any XULRunner-based application licensed under the Mozilla Public
