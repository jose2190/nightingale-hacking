The rest of the source for this (the Concerts add-on) is covered under the
below BSD license + Patent License

The POTI BSD + Patent License has been written to provide maximum flexibility
to the recipient, as it does not require the recipient to use a particular
license for the recipient's derivative software (unlike the GPL), nor does it
require the recipient to grant any patent licenses to the recipient's
derivative software (unlike the GPL). 

In addition, the POTI BSD + Patent License (unlike the BSD license) grants a
patent license from POTI not only to POTI's Concerts add-on (the "Software")
itself, but also to any POTI patent claims that might cover corrections made
by the recipient.

The text of the POTI BSD + Patent License follows:

Recipient has requested a license and Pioneers of the Inevitable, Incorporated
("POTI") is willing to grant a license for the software entitled Songbird
Concerts Add-On (the "Software") being provided by POTI. 

The following definitions apply to this
license:

* "Licensed Patents" means patent claims licensable by POTI, which are
  necessarily infringed by the use or sale of the Software alone or when
  combined with the XULRunner-based applications referred to below.

* "Recipient" means the party to whom POTI delivers
  the software.

* "Licensee" means Recipient and those third parties that receive a license
  to any XULRunner-based application licensed under the Mozilla Public
  License (MPL), Lesser GNU Public License (LGPL), or GNU Public License (GPL).
