/**
 * \interface sbIWFMoveRenameHelper9000 
 * \brief A hackish service that helps the watch folder component
 *        gracefully handle moved or renamed files.
 * Since the watch folders are only notified of added and removed
 * paths, we have to make educated guesses when files are moved or 
 * renamed.  If we don't we delete and then re-add media items, b
 * breaking existing playlists and lose information like ratings.
 *
 * Ultimately the file system watcher should be able to report
 * move and rename events, but that is not possible at this time.
 * This is a temporary helper for the watch folders only, and should  
 * not be used anywhere else.
