   * Generate lists of items to sync in 2-way sync.
   *
   * \param aMediaTypesToExportAll The media types (bit mask) to export all

   * \param aMediaTypesToImportAll The media types (bit mask) to import all
   *                         of to the source library.
   * \param aSourceLibrary   The source library for the sync operation - usually
   *                         the main library.
   * \param aDestLibrary     The destination library for the sync operation -
   *                         usually a device library
   * \param aSourceLists     Array of playlists to export to the destination
   *                         library. Used when a media type is NOT passed in
   *                         aMediaTypesToExportAll. May be null to indicate
   *                         that no playlists are to be exported.
   * \param aExportChangeset The changeset describing items to be exported to
   *                         the destination (device) library.
   *                         This will be non-null if SYNC_FLAG_EXPORT_ALL or
   *                         SYNC_FLAG_EXPORT_PLAYLISTS is passed (though the
   *                         changeset may still be empty in that case!)
   *                         In this list, an ADDED item should be added to the
   *                         destination library, and the corresponding file
   *                         copied (or transcoded) to the target.
   *                         A MODIFIED item should be modified in the target
   *                         library (the target item will be given in the
   *                         sbILibraryChange), and the target file overwritten.
   * \param aImportChangeset The changeset describing items to be imported to
   *                         the source (main) library.
   *                         This will be non-null if SYNC_FLAG_IMPORT is
   *                         passed (though the changeset may still be empty)
   *                         Here, an ADDED item should be added to the source
   *                         (main) library. A MODIFIED item will, likewise,
   *                         modify an existing item 
   *                         (sbILibraryChange::destinationItem), but note that
   *                         this MUST only ever occur for lists. Thus, there is
   *                         no actual target file to overwrite.
   *                         It would be an internal error for an
   *                         sbILibraryChange in this list to have
   *                         operation == MODIFIED, and isList false.
