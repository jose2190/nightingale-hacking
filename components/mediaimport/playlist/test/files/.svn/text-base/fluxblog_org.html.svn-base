<b>The Thrill Of Fear</b>
<br />
<a name="1975730061282050697">&nbsp;</a><br>
<div style="clear:both;"></div><span style="font-family:arial;">I did something with </span><span style="font-family:arial;">Björk</span><span style="font-family:arial;">'s new album <span style="font-style: italic;">Volta</span> that I haven't done in a long time: I didn't download a leaked copy or receive an advance cd, and I bought it the day it came out in a record store.  I did that for three reasons:</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">1) Novelty and nostalgia. I still buy cds here and there, but it's been quite a while since I purchased one without being extremely well acquainted with its contents. In fact, Björk's 2001 album <span style="font-style: italic;">Vespertine</span> was among the last that I experienced without knowing exactly what I was getting into. I suspect that my disappointment with that record had a lot to do with feeling burned by my monetary investment -- for the longest time, I only really liked "Hidden Place," "Unison," and "Cocoon," but I've recently discovered that I do enjoy at least three or four others from that album, and hey, <span style="font-style: italic;">Medulla</span> isn't so bad either.  It's my fault, really -- I was being arrogant and stubborn, and I made no effort to meet her halfway when it became clear that she wasn't going to give me exactly what I wanted.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">2) It didn't leak in full until very late in the game. I can hold out for a couple weeks, but ultimately, my will is not very strong.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">3) I was thoroughly wowed by the songs I heard in advance of its release. Since I wasn't very into <span style="font-style: italic;">Medulla</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Vespertine</span>, my expectations were fairly low -- all I was hope for was at least a couple good upbeat dancey numbers.  My wish was granted immediately: "Earth Intruders" rekindled my faith in her and prompted me to reexamine the previous two albums, and "Innocence" surpassed my wildest dreams by being more or less EXACTLY what I've been wanting from her for all this time. "Wanderlust" didn't leave a strong first impression when I saw her perform it on Saturday Night Live, but the youtube clip of  the aggressive electro-punk number </span><a style="font-family: arial;" href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=aM8SXfB5NHg" target="_blank">"Declare Independence"</a><span style="font-family:arial;"> from Coachella kinda blew my mind.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">Now that I have the record and have been listening to it for a couple days, I'm fairly certain that those are the four best cuts on <span style="font-style: italic;">Volta</span>, but I'm not at all disappointed about that. How could I be? Those four songs are brilliant, and some of the best material that anyone has released this year. The other selections aren't bad, either -- "Vertebrae By Vertebrae" and "I Know Who You Are" have their charm, and I'm learning to appreciate "The Dull Flame Of Desire" and "My Juvenile" despite the mildly aggravating presence of </span><a style="font-family: arial;" href="http://marchogan.blogspot.com/2007/04/be-music-critic-get-power-over-women.html" target="_blank">Antony Hegarty.</a><span style="font-family:arial;">  Volta may not be on the same level of consistent greatness as <span style="font-style: italic;">Debut</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Post,</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Homogenic</span>, but it's a strong piece of work, and a welcome return to eclecticism after two albums that were weakened somewhat by their adherence to gimmicky high concepts.</span><br /><br /><a style="font-family: arial;" href="http://www.fluxblog.net/bjork_innocence.mp3" target="_blank">Björk "Innocence"</a> - <span style="font-family:arial;">As I mentioned earlier, "Innocence" is the song I've been wanting from Björk for a long time now, and I suppose what I mean is that musically and lyrically, it is basically the third part of a trilogy which also includes my two favorite tracks in her discography, </span><a style="font-family: arial;" href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=LKzPB_ekP1o" target="_blank">"Big Time Sensuality"</a><span style="font-family:arial;"> and </span><a style="font-family: arial;" href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=rCtzQ6KbWWY" target="_blank">"Alarm Call."</a><span style="font-family:arial;"> This is the Björk that I love the most: Upbeat, courageous, optimistic, and in full control of her neuroses. "Big Time Sensuality" confronts the future with enthusiasm, "Alarm Call" is defiantly unafraid of the world and its inhabitants,  and "Innocence" conquers fear by embracing its thrill. The message is essentially the same in each song, but her authority increases as she goes along -- "Big Time Sensuality" is a youthful song about faith and risk, and "Innocence" has the perspective to understand the mechanics of overcoming anxiety. Whereas her declarations in "Alarm Call" seem like surprising self-revelations, her words in "Innocence" seem directed outside of herself, as a bit of advice for the listener. It's Björk in life coach mode: "neurosis only attaches itself to fertile ground where it can flourish;" "fear is a powerful drug -- overcome it and you think you can do anything!;" "fear of losing energy is draining." The best thing is that she's absolutely correct, and though she is extraordinarily hopeful in her encouragement, she doesn't lose sight of the immense difficulty and painful work involved in fighting our worst impulses. </span><span style=";font-family:arial;color:red;"  >(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Volta-Bj%C3%B6rk/dp/B000NVIXFA/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-6216849-5153533?ie=UTF8&s=music&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;qid=1178815345&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Click here</a> to buy it from Amazon.)</span><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

<div style="clear:both;"></div><a style="font-family: arial;" href="http://www.fluxblog.net/scoutniblett_dinosauregg.mp3" target="_blank">Scout Niblett "Dinosaur Egg"</a><span style="font-family:arial;"> - The most consistently inspired and entertaining part of DC Comics' otherwise erratic weekly series </span><a style="font-family: arial;" href="http://www.dccomics.com/sites/52/" target="_blank">52</a><span style="font-family:arial;"> was a subplot written by </span><a style="font-family: arial;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Morrison" target="_blank">Grant Morrison</a><span style="font-family:arial;"> in which most of the mad scientists in the DC Universe are held captive on Oolong Island by the enormous egg-shaped "mutant flesh machine" </span><a style="font-family: arial;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_Fu" target="_blank">Chang Tzu.</a><span style="font-family:arial;"> They aren't exactly prisoners -- it's an island paradise, and they are all "given an unlimited budget and encouraged to let their imaginations run wild on the finest mind-expanding narcotics available to man." The scientists are, as another character describes them, "groping, stumbling, self-conscious man-boys...autistic midget savants." They aren't exactly evil, but they are all twisted by their enormous egos and total lack of social grace.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">Scout Niblett's "Dinosaur Egg" sounds as though it is being sung from the perspective of one of these cowardly, emotionally damaged creeps. Niblett's character impatiently demands a dinosaur egg to hatch, bosses around her robot slave, and calls upon a "tortured spirit" to help her frighten her guests at some sort of bizarre social gathering. (I kinda get the impression that the "guests" will all be there under duress.) The music is stark and fragile like an old school Cat Power tune, and Niblett manages to express her character's petulance, insecurity, and impotent rage in a way that's at least somewhat sympathetic. </span><span style=";font-family:arial;color:red;"  >(<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Just-Do-Scout-Niblett/dp/B000PITY36/ref=pd_bbs_sr_6/202-8471307-7073450?ie=UTF8&s=music&amp;amp;amp;qid=1178709080&sr=8-6" target="_blank">Click here</a> to buy it from Amazon UK.)</span><br /><br /><a style="font-family: arial;" href="http://www.fluxblog.net/guiborrato_beautifullife.mp3" target="_blank">Gui Boratto "Beautiful Life"</a><span style="font-family: arial;"> - This is another fine example of a song with lyrics that simply offer a subtitle for the feeling expressed by the music -- "what a beautiful life, what a beautiful life, what a beautiful life." Boratto's track simulates and stimulates a state of calm bliss that feels almost unnatural. The beat snaps with just enough aggression to trigger physical movement, but it mostly just guides us through a succession of keyboard hooks that wash over the listener like cool waves of pleasure. </span><span style="font-family: arial;color:red;" >(<a href="http://www.ampcamp.com/product_info.php?&amp;products_id=3588" target="_blank">Click here</a> to buy it from Amp Camp.)</span><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

<div style="clear:both;"></div><u style="font-family: arial;">Arcade Fire @ United Palace, 5/7/2007</u><br /><small style="font-family: arial;">Black Mirror / No Cars Go / Laika / Haiti / Black Wave/Bad Vibrations / Neon Bible / Windowsill / The Well & The Lighthouse / Ocean Of Noise / Keep The Car Running / Antichrist Television Blues / Power Out / Rebellion (Lies) // Tunnels / Intervention</small><br /><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">I'm not crazy about the </span><a style="font-family: arial;" href="http://www.theunitedpalace.com/home.htm" target="_blank">United Palace</a><span style="font-family:arial;">. For one thing, the acoustics leave a lot to be desired, and the band was never loud enough. I realize that the volume thing may be an Arcade Fire issue -- they have a bazillion instruments going all at once, and the sound people are clearly making an effort to balance it out so that the more delicate instruments can be heard with some detail. Sarah Neufeld may disagree with me on this, but I think that's ultimately a bad idea. At least half of the reason why we go to see live shows is to hear the music really loud, so that we can FEEL the music vibrate through our bodies and enjoy a physical sensation that we can't get from playing the records at home unless we happen to have extremely forgiving and/or passive neighbors. The mix and the acoustics of the room flattered slow, quiet numbers like "Neon Bible" and "Ocean of Noise," but the majority of the set focused on the driving, enormous rock songs that are the band's specialty, and something was lost.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">Maybe it was because I was so far in the back? My other issue with the United Palace is that I resent the fact that I bought my tickets within 40 seconds of them being put on sale, and yet I was still stuck in the last row of the highest balcony, and the people who bought the tickets released on the day of show got to be in the front. How on earth is that fair to anyone? Shouldn't the worst seats be reserved for the day-of-show tickets?</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">The venue is surprisingly large, relatively well managed, and ridiculously ornate, but it lacks the  charm and exceptional sound quality of the fairly similar </span><a style="font-family: arial;" href="http://www.loewsjersey.org/" target="_blank">Landmark Loews Theatre</a><span style="font-family:arial;"> in Jersey City. I'm more than a little ambivalent about the prospect of the place becoming the go-to venue for medium-large acts in NYC for the foreseeable future, but I suppose that it might be a nice thing for Columbia students or people in Washington Heights.</span><br /><br /><a style="font-family: arial;" href="http://www.fluxblog.net/arcadefire_thewelllive.mp3" target="_blank">Arcade Fire "The Well & The Lighthouse" (Live @ Judson Memorial Church 2/17/2007)</a><span style="font-family:arial;"> - Anyway, the Arcade Fire, right. They played a show. It was a good show -- I think. They definitely played good songs, and it seemed like they did a pretty nice job of it. I was definitely really into that stretch in the middle from "The Well &amp; The Lighthouse" on through "Antichrist Television Blues." Like I said, I felt a bit removed from the performance. I've been much further away from the stage and felt more physically engaged, so I'm not going to blame my proximity. There was something kinda odd about my vantage point -- I was peering down over them from an angle that somehow flattened everything so that it looked sorta like a puppet show. Everyone on the stage looked like tiny toy replicas of themselves. That skewed perspective benefited "The Well & The Lighthouse," a song that sounds as though it should smell like a musty old book, and seems exceptionally well suited to being played in miniature on an fancy, old timey stage.  Just as when I saw the band back in February, the slow, elegant fade out at the end of that number was the single loveliest moment of their show, though this time the audience started clapping a bit too early. </span><span style=";font-family:arial;color:red;"  >(<a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7273765" target="_blank">Click here</a> to get the full Judson Memorial Church show from NPR and <a href="http://mergerecords.com/catalog.php?method=band&amp;amp;query_band_id=98&amp;" target="_blank">here</a> to buy Arcade Fire music from Merge.)</span><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

The song is overwhelmingly upbeat and assertive to the point that it's shouting out its own negativity -- "you treat me so bad, but honey, it's alright" --  and creating a positive outcome by sheer force of will. </span><span style=";font-family:arial;color:red;"  >(<a href="http://www.soundlinkmusic.com/catalog/psychic-circle/various-artists-hide-and-seek/prod_98.html" target="_blank">Click here</a> to buy it from Soundlink.)</span><br /><br /><a style="font-family: arial;" href="http://www.fluxblog.net/paulhaig_runningaway.mp3" target="_blank">Paul Haig "Runnin' Away"</a><span style="font-family:arial;"> - Paul Haig's 1982 version of Sly and the Family Stone's "Runnin' Away" has a slightly kitschy charm to it without pushing too far into obnoxious novelty or cheap irony.  It's a very smart song selection -- though most Sly songs require a certain fire and passion, the clipped and somewhat deadpan delivery of the original lends itself well to being covered by post-punkers. That said, the reason Haig's arrangement works mainly comes down to the way he transposed Sly's brass hooks to a colorful synthesizer tone that sounds cut-rate, shoddy, and inexplicably comforting. </span><span style=";font-family:arial;color:red;"  >(<a href="http://www8.cd-wow.us/detail_results.php?product_code=1947739" target="_blank">Click here</a> buy it from CD Wow.)</span><br /><br /><b style="font-family: arial;">Elsewhere:</b><span style="font-family:arial;"> This will probably make absolutely no sense if you did not read </span><a style="font-family: arial;" href="http://www.dccomics.com/sites/52/" target="_blank">52</a><span style="font-family:arial;">, but </span><a style="font-family: arial;" href="http://dibnydiary.blogspot.com/2007/05/heaven-can-suck-it.html" target="_blank">the final entry of The Diary of Ralph Dibny</a><span style="font-family:arial;"> is a classic, and definitely one of the best things you'll find anywhere on the internet this week.</span><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

They quit while they were ahead and can claim a spotless legacy, and while that's quite cool and sorta romantic, it's incredibly frustrating just the same. There's a certain magic to the sound of Life Without Buildings' music, but there's no good reason for the audience, much less the band themselves, to imagine that they weren't capable of topping or at least matching that sort of inspiration. As a fan/consumer, it's awfully convenient when an artist's body of work is a one-stop-shopping deal, but how do we know when we couldn't have it so much better? Why are we all so frightened of the valleys that accompany the peaks of the creative process? </span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">"Liberty Feelup" (or as Sue Tompkins speak-sings it, "Liberty F<span style="font-style: italic;">eeeee</span>lup") is the one "new" song on the band's forthcoming live album, and it's so good that it breaks my heart all over again. It sticks to the basic formula of <span style="font-style: italic;">Any Other City</span>, but it doesn't seem at all like they were lacking in ideas. If anything, it suggests that they abandoned their brilliant personal style a bit too soon. Tompkins still seems as though she's communicating the breadth of the human experience with every cryptic, repeated line, and the music ebbs and flows with their characteristic blend of serenity and urgency. Like the rest of their work, the song sounds tossed off but incredibly passionate and brave as Tompkins seems to stare down the inevitabilities of life and death while grinning like a loon.</span><span style=";font-family:arial;color:red;"  > (<a href="http://www.lifewithoutbuildings.com/" target="_blank">Click here</a> for the official Life Without Buildings site.)</span><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

As a result, it's sort of impossible for me to hear their music without feeling incredibly proud of what she's accomplished with her band mates in the past two years. I'm reasonably certain that I'd be a fan of the group whether I knew them or not, but you know, it's kinda hard to describe just how cool it is to see someone you've known and loved for so long finally find herself as an artist and then go on to become internationally famous for her work. It's not just Heather -- her partners Annie and Erika are two of the loveliest women you could ever hope to meet, and watching them evolve as musicians and performers has been just as inspiring.</span><br /><br /><a style="font-family: arial;" href="http://www.fluxblog.net/aurevoirsimone_stars.mp3" target="_blank">Au Revoir Simone "Stars"</a><span style="font-family:arial;"> - I've had a copy of "Stars" for quite a while now, and for a lot of that time, it was kinda driving me crazy that I couldn't share it with all of you. Then the album leaked, and it was released in Europe, and though I had permission to post it, I kinda froze up because I don't know how to write about this music in an honest way without being sappy and sentimental. In fairness, it's kind of a sappy, sentimental song -- it's essentially about the sort of intense fascination and excitement you feel when you meet someone new and inspiring. It works very well as a love or crush song, but it was written about platonic friendship, and that's a lot to do with why the tune has this wonderful innocent quality.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">"Stars" has a gorgeous, sparkling arrangement and one of the catchiest melodies of anything I've heard this year, but I suspect that it's my favorite of their songs because it's the one that is the most Heather-ish. She's the primary author of this particular track, and whether she intended it or not, it sums up so much of what is great about her -- the wide-eyed enthusiasm, the intellectual curiosity (it might help to hear this song with the knowledge that she studies astrophysics at Columbia), the suburban roots, the romanticism, the mix of self-possession and unapologetic girlishness. Seriously, I just can't hear it without feeling sappy. I wish that all of you had songs written by your friends that could remind you just why you like them so much in the first place. </span><span style=";font-family:arial;color:red;"  >(<a href="http://search.insound.com/search/showrelease.jsp?p=INS35834" target="_blank">Click here</a> to buy it from Insound.)</span><br /><br /><u style="font-family: arial;">Peter, Bjorn & John @ Webster Hall 5/2/2007</u><br /><small style="font-family: arial;">Roll The Credits / Let's Call It Off / See Through / The Chills / Start To Melt / Amsterdam / Paris 2004 / Tailormade / Young Folks (with Heather D'Angelo) / Objects Of My Affection / Up Against The Wall // Poor Cow / Far Away, By My Side / Teen Love</small><br /><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">One more thing to be proud of: Heather sang Victoria Bergsman's part in "Young Folks" with Peter, Bjorn and John last night, and she did a rather fantastic job of it.

Peter dialed down his charisma a bit for this show, but he was still very magnetic and amiable throughout the performance. Aside from "Young Folks," the highlight of the set was an extended version of "Up Against The Wall" that kept going through at least three false starts before finally ending with just Peter strumming his guitar and plaintively singing the title. A PB&J concert album might be a bit redundant, but they really ought to release a live recording of this particular number.</span><span style=";font-family:arial;color:red;"  ><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Writers-Block-Peter-Bjorn-John/dp/B000NJL4TY/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2/104-6216849-5153533?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;qid=1178198703&sr=8-2" target="_blank"> <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">(</span>Click here</a> to buy it from Amazon.)</span><br /><br /><b style="font-family: arial;">Elsewhere:</b><span style="font-family:arial;"> My new Hit Refresh column is </span><a style="font-family: arial;" href="http://asap.ap.org/stories/1416992.s" target="_blank">up on the ASAP site</a><span style="font-family:arial;"> with mp3s from Wild Beasts, Lucky Soul, and Good Shoes.</span><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

I honestly have no idea -- the promo packaging does not include any detailed songwriting credits, and so I'm not sure whether or not the suspiciously familiar keyboard pulse is lifted directly from her song, or is just rather similar in tone and attack. Aside from that bit, "Don and Sherri" isn't much like a Kylie tune at all. Whereas her material tends to move on to a huge, glorious hook and/or a grand release, Matthew Dear's song is stuck in a paranoid, frustrated groove that presumably extends well beyond the point where the track fades out. </span><span style=";font-family:arial;color:red;"  >(<a href="http://www.ghostly.com/1.0/ghostly/gi65.shtml" target="_blank">Click here</a> to pre-order it from Ghostly International.)</span><br /><br /><a style="font-family: arial;" href="http://www.fluxblog.net/djblaqstarr_shakeittotheground_pistolpete.mp3" target="_blank">DJ Blaqstarr featuring Rye Rye "Shake It To The Ground (Pistol Pete Remix)"</a><span style="font-family:arial;"> -  Though it's not quite as intense and mindblowing as </span><a style="font-family: arial;" href="http://www.fluxblog.org/2006/12/mirror-mirror_01.html" target="_blank">his Clipse remix</a><span style="font-family:arial;">, Pistol Pete's latest track continues to push in an electro direction that's one part cheesy and three parts awesome.  Pete's arrangement fleshes out Blaqstarr's song without totally betraying the stark beauty of the original version, which was so focused on Rye Rye's rap that it sounded almost like a glorified a cappella. Rye Rye is still front and center in the mix, but she's carried along by a track that emphasizes and accentuates her hooks rather than just prop them up. </span><span style=";font-family:arial;color:red;"  >(<a href="http://www.myspace.com/pistolpetelovesyou" target="_blank">Click here</a> for Pistol Pete's MySpace page.)</span><br /><br /><b style="font-family: arial;">Elsewhere:</b><span style="font-family:arial;"> </span><a style="font-family: arial;" href="http://fasthugs.typepad.com/blog/2007/04/dead_poets_drum.html" targe="_blank">Fast Hugs on the weirdness of Natasha Bedingfield</a><span style="font-family:arial;">, </span><a style="font-family: arial;" href="http://cokanesbloggery.blogspot.com/2007/05/full-metal-jackets.html" target="_blank">Cokane's Bloggery revisits the denim rock jacket</a><span style="font-family:arial;">, and </span><a style="font-family: arial;" href="http://www.ruinedmusic.com/" target="_blank">Ruined Music returns from a brief hiatus.</a><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

The best Electrelane songs walk up to edge of huge emotional revelations without diving into them, as though simply admitting to potent  feelings is the same as freely expressing them. Susman's voice is level and rational even as she peers over that edge, but she's never lacking a certain warmth and humanity. </span><span style="font-family: arial;color:red;" >(<a href="http://search.insound.com/search/showrelease.jsp?p=INS35991" target="_blank">Click here</a> to buy it from Insound.)</span><br /><br /><a style="font-family: arial;" href="http://www.fluxblog.net/montag_mechanicalkids.mp3" target="_blank">Montag "Mechanical Kids"</a><span style="font-family: arial;"> - It's very difficult not to hear this song as being much more than a peevish slap on the conformity of young people, but there's an optimistic tone to the music that keeps the composition from feeling too mean-spirited, smug, or judgmental.

It was a fairly typical Yo La Tengo show: mostly songs from the new album, a smattering of delicate quiet tunes, a handful of extremely noisy jams, a few old "hits" to get the old school fans pumped up every 30 minutes or so. Oh, and this may come as a shock, but they also played some OBSCURE COVERS!

As on the album, the arrangement is limited to two overdriven organs played by Ira Kaplan and a storm of percussion performed by Georgia Hubley on her drum kit and James McNew on a set of bongos. Basically, it sounds a bit like the Silver Apples if their homemade synthesizers got replaced by the organ at a baseball stadium. The sound of the piece is very effective in mirroring its lyrical themes -- it feels claustrophobic, humid,  and slightly vertiginous, and even when the tension breaks near the end, it's only a minor relief. </span><span style=";font-family:arial;color:red;"  >(<a href="http://search.insound.com/search/showrelease.jsp?p=INS30262" target="_blank">Click here</a> to buy it from Insound)</span><br /><br /><b style="font-family: arial;">Also:</b><span style="font-family:arial;"> If you were curious, this is what I played when I DJ'd the other night.

Side A alternates between ethereal drones and intense Kraut-punk-shoegazer hybrids before culminating in a cut that seamlessly combines both extremes, and Side B is mostly comprised of songs that sound like they might have been one of the last few tracks on a CMJ New Music Monthly cd back in the early 90s. (Surely I'm not the only one who has noticed that </span><a style="font-family: arial;" href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=2wpc1lhFfMA" target="_blank">"Strange Lights"</a><span style="font-family:arial;">  sounds a LOT like Guided By Voices circa <span style="font-style: italic;">Alien Lanes</span>.)  Whereas <span style="font-style: italic;">Cryptograms</span> wanders around in search of itself, the new <span style="font-style: italic;">Fluorescent Grey</span> EP follows a tight, deliberate trajectory that begins with a state of eerie calmness and ends with a headlong rush into oblivion. It's a more focused recording, and does more to establish the band's identity than its eclectic predecessor.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">Actually, that's not quite right. If you want to get an accurate sense of who Deerhunter are, you kinda have to see them play live. The band nail their dynamics in live performance, but they also have an appealing looseness to their interaction that adds a sense of unpredictability to their set. It's not a shock that the songs from the EP work just as well with the piano parts transposed to guitar, but it is somewhat surprising that the sort of beatless drones that drag on <span style="font-style: italic;">Cryptograms</span>' momentum are actually quite compelling in person.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:arial;">The band themselves have a curious dynamic -- the bassist and guitarist on the right side of the stage are both a bit silly and playful, but the singer Bradford Cox is severe, creepy, and theatrical. Cox is very tall and extremely skinny, and he spent most of the show with his face smeared with fake blood and dressed in a white babydoll dress, like a giant undead grandma. He seemed like something David Bowie might have come up with during his coke psychosis phase, and some patient handler would have had to explain to him "No, David, you can't elongate your body and eliminate all of your fat and muscle mass." It was hard not to watch him; he seemed totally unreal.</span><span style=";font-family:arial;color:red;"  > (<a href="http://www.ampcamp.com/product_info.php?&products_id=3063&amp;osCsid=25b337b01ff1189bc7b7536d1dc7608a" target="_blank">Click here</a> to buy it from AmpCamp.)</span><br /><br /><u style="font-family: arial;">Pterodactyl @ Mercury Lounge 4/26/2007</u><br /><small style="font-family: arial;">Safe Like A Train / Ask Me Nicely / I Can See A River / Astros / Verbal / Three Succeed / Esses / New / Polio</small><br /><br /><a style="font-family: arial;" href="http://www.fluxblog.net/pterodactyl_threesucceed.mp3" target="_blank">Pterodactyl "Three Succeed"</a><span style="font-family:arial;"> - It occurred to me about a week ago that the sort of shrieking guitar noises that the band Pterodactyl makes actually come close to the sounds we commonly associate with pterodactyls from cartoons and movies. The group recreate their melodic noise-punk songs very effectively in person, or at least well enough to leave my ears ringing twelve hours later. Though watching them play demystified their playing somewhat by revealing their techniques (ah, that sound in "Three Succeed" is made by sticking a drumstick under the strings above the pickups on the bass, okay...), it's always a thrill to see a band manhandle their instruments in a way that it seems like there is no way they are actually playing them, and yet very specific sounds are produced. </span><span style=";font-family:arial;color:red;"  >(<a href="http://www.cardboardrecords.com/" target="_blank">Click here</a> to pre-order it from Cardboard Records.)</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:arial;"><a href="http://www.myspace.com/firstnationlove" target="_blank">First Nation</a> played a set of what seemed to be entirely new material between Pterodactyl and Deerhunter.  I'd never seen First Nation before last night, and so I didn't really know what to expect; I just knew that I liked a couple songs from their first record. I was pretty down with the first three or four songs, but then their set just kept going and going, and the things that worked well at the start became very grating. They make the best of their technical limitations by settling into simple, mesmerizing rhythms and melodies, but not every song was strong enough to compensate for their flaws as musicians. They are definitely on the right track, though.<br /><br /><b>Also:</b> Kinda last minute, but I'm <a href="http://static.going.com/thumbnails/35f/wh524_1500_user_20070409_164947_0.96023500.jpeg" target="_blank">DJing with LadyByrd at the Lotus Lounge on Clinton and Stanton tonight.</a><br /><br /></span><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

At some points the guitar stabs venture in Nu-Metal territory, but for the most part, they sound more like short, abstracted clangs that complement the incessant clatter of a ride cymbal.

It's exciting and refreshing, but really, it's just a prelude to something more profound.  The music expresses the song's emotional narrative more effectively than the lyrics, which mostly just offer advice and reassuring words. The verses are supported by a spare, slightly nervous electronic groove, but as the song shifts into its chorus, the song is carried by a more confident beat. The track's most glorious moment comes following a breakdown towards the end -- the beat comes down stronger than ever, and Siri ålberg's voice doubles up and overlaps its melodies before returning to the song's stunning yet understated chorus. </span><span style="font-family: arial;color:red;" >(<a href="http://www.sissywish.com/" target="_blank">Click here</a> for the official Sissy Wish site.)</span><br /><br /><a style="font-family: arial;" href="http://www.fluxblog.net/wildbeasts_throughdarknight.mp3" target="_blank">Wild Beasts "Through Dark Night"</a><span style="font-family: arial;"> - "Through Dark Night" may not be as immediately flooring as the Wild Beasts' previous single </span><a style="font-family: arial;" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6Z1ABZ1iQU" target="_blank">"Brave Bulging Buoyant Clairvoyants"</a><span style="font-family: arial;">, but its low key arrangement and shimmering guitar parts highlight the prettiest aspects of Hayden Norman Thorpe's incredibly weird singing voice. Thorpe still sounds a bit like Scooby Doo at some points, but the balance is shifted in favor of his lovely falsetto, and the contrast between the masculine and feminine qualities of his voice is less jarring and extreme.
