* \interface sbIDatabaseQuery
* \brief An object responsible for executing SQL queries on the database
*
* The sbIDatabaseQuery object is used to execute queries on the underlying
* databases that store library and playlist data.
*
* While client code running from chrome is free to query the databases
* directly, this object is more commonly passed to the database helper objects
* that translate their methods into SQL queries placed into the passed 
* sbIDatabaseQuery instance.
*
* The basic loop for using a query is as follows:
*
* 1) Object Initialization - setDatabaseGUID(), optionally setAsyncQuery(), 
* set callbacks, etc
*
* 2) Query Construction - addQuery(), or calls to the helper objects
*
* 3) Execution - execute(), optionally waitForCompletion()
*
* 4) Get Results - getResultObject(), the returned object may be null 
*    if there was an error. You should always check the value returned
*    by execute. 
*
* 5) Reset - optionally resetQuery(), if you're going to reuse the object
* with a new set of query strings
* 
* Multiple queries may be added to the object via multiple calls to addQuery,
* or multiple calls to the helper interfaces.  The queries will execute
* sequentially and the result object will be for the last query executed.
