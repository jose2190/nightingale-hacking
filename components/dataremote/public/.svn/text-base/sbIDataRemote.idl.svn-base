 * \interface sbIDataRemote
 * \brief An interface for accessing, and binding to, stored data.
 *
 * This interface defines the ability to set key-value pairs into a global
 *   data-store, and to observe changes in the value of the data. The observer
 *   can be bound to the data in one of three different ways. A callback object
 *   can be bound as an nsIObserver, or a DOM element can bind the value of an
 *   attribute or a property to the value of the data.
 *
 * The attribute and property bindings can be done as string, integer or
 *   boolean, and in the case of boolean binding the value can be the inverse
 *   of the data value. In addition the actual value for the attribute or
 *   property can be defined by additional script executed in the notification 
 *   step.
