Class: Library

A <Library> is a collection of <MediaItems> and <MediaLists>.
It is possible to create a <Library> using the <Songbird::siteLibrary>
function.

Inherits:
  <MediaList> <MediaItem>

Example:
  (start code)
  //Create or get a library.
  var library = songbird.siteLibrary("", "");

  //Create a medialist using the library.
  var mediaList = library.createSimpleMediaList("Name of List");

  //Create some mediaitems and add them to the medialist.
  var itemURLs = ["http://path/to/song.mp3", "http://path/to/another/song.mp3"];
  for(var url in itemURLs) {

    //Calling createMediaItem may throw an exception when it fails
    //to create the mediaitem.

    try {
      var mediaItem = library.createMediaItem(url);
      mediaList.add(mediaItem);
    }
    catch(e) {

      //Dump it.
      dump("Failed creation of mediaitem: " + e);

      //Or alert it.
      alert("Failed creation of mediaitem: " + e);

      //Oops the URL was not valid.
      if(e.result == Components.results.NS_ERROR_INVALID_ARG) {
