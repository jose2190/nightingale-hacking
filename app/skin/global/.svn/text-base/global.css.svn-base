SONGBIRD GLOBAL SKIN

A chrome://global/skin provider intended for use with feathers that fully
style all XUL elements.

The goal of the Songbird global is to provide a stable, minimal
basis on which user feathers can build.  

The global skin package contains images and style sheets loaded
by the standard XUL elements, as well as global.css, which is
loaded by all chrome windows.  

Global is usually the platform specific provider included in
XULRunner (Winstripe on Windows, and Pinstripe on Mac).  
This makes things difficult when Songbird feathers want complete
control over look and feel, and want the same appearance on
all platforms.

Feathers request the Songbird global through entries in their
chrome.manifest configuration file.  See the Rubberducky chrome.manifest
for an example.
