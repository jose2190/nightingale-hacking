<p>Content providers are using the Microsoft digital rights management technology for Windows Media (&ldquo;WM-DRM&rdquo;) to protect the integrity of their content (&ldquo;Secure Content&rdquo;) so that their intellectual property, including copyright, in such content is not misappropriated. Portions of this software and other third party applications (&ldquo;WM-DRM Software&rdquo;) use WM-DRM to transfer or play Secure Content.</p>
<p>If the WM-DRM Software's security has been compromised, owners of Secure Content (&ldquo;Secure Content Owners&rdquo;) may request that Microsoft revoke the WM-DRM Software's right to copy, display, transfer, and/or play Secure Content. Revocation does not alter the WM-DRM Software's ability to play unprotected content. A list of revoked WM-DRM Software is sent to your computer whenever you download a license for Secure Content from the Internet.</p>
<p>Microsoft may, in conjunction with such license, also download revocation lists onto your computer on behalf of Secure Content Owners. Secure Content Owners may also require you to upgrade some of the WM-DRM components distributed with this software (&ldquo;WM-DRM Upgrades&rdquo;) before accessing their content. When you attempt to play such content, WM-DRM Software built by Microsoft will notify you that a WM-DRM Upgrade is required and then ask for your consent before the WM-DRM Upgrade is downloaded. WM-DRM Software used by third parties may do the same.</p>
<p>If you decline the upgrade, you will not be able to access content that requires the WM-DRM Upgrade; however, you will still be able to access unprotected content and Secure Content that does not require the upgrade.</p>
