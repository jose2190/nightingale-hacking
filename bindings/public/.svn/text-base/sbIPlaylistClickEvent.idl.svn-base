Event: PlaylistClickEvent

A <PlaylistClickEvent> is passed to any event handlers listening for the
PlaylistCellClick event fired on the document object.  This event object also
has some of the properties of MouseEvent.

Note that the <Songbird> object must be accessed before any events will be raised.
This will likely change in the future.

Fired on:
  document

Properties inherited from MouseEvent:
ctrlKey - true if the control key is down when the click occurred
altKey - true if the alt key is down
shiftKey - true if the shift key is down
metaKey - true if the meta key is down
button - which mouse button was pressed;
         0 for primary, 1 for middle, and 2 for secondary.
type - constant string, "PlaylistCellClick"
target - the document object of the content page which displayed the playlist
bubbles - contant true
cancelable - constant true
timeStamp - the time at which the click occurred, as milliseconds from epoch

Properties inherited from MouseEvent, but not used:
screenX
screenY
clientX
clientY
relatedTarget
view
detail

Example:
  (start code)
  function onPlaylistCellClick( aEvent ) {
    // we can get the property that was clicked on...
    alert(aEvent.property);
    
    // or the <MediaItem>
    alert(aEvent.item.guid);
    
    // as well as key states from MouseEvent
    alert(aEvent.ctrlKey);
  }
  
  // initialize the event system
  songbird;
  
  // attach the event handler
  document.addEventListener("PlaylistCellClick", onPlaylistCellClick, false);
  (end code)
